# ** Problem Introduction
## The USPS provides commercial shippers with unique Mailer Identification Numbers (MID) to manifest and pay for their postage.  Fraudulent shippers use a combination of hijacked MIDs, where a fraudulent shipper steals a MID assigned to a USPS customer, and unregistered MIDs, a MID that has not been setup to enter packages into the USPS package stream. USPS package fraud detection is currently a retroactive process to identify fraudulent packages.  The time lag creates an opportunity for fraudulent MIDs to go undetected while also providing time for fraudulent shippers to create new fraudulent MIDs before USPS can address.

# Problem Definition

## Blue Barracudas has been tasked with developing an AI/ML algorithm that utilizes a sample of USPS shipment data to allow USPS to shorten the detection time of fraudulent package shipments. ***
